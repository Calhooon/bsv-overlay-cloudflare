# bsv-overlay-cloudflare

Rust port of [`@bsv/overlay-express`][ts] deployed on Cloudflare Workers.
Two cargo workspaces in one repository (see "Two workspaces"), compiled to WebAssembly. 1:1 protocol parity with
mainline 2.2.0, proven by a differential harness.

## Two workspaces (bsv-low #553, 2026-10-06)

The ROOT workspace (`Cargo.toml`: `overlay-engine`, `overlay-discovery`,
`parity-harness`) is what a consumer pins by git rev. It must build from a
fresh clone of this repository ALONE, so no member may carry a path
dependency that leaves the repository. Cargo reads a path dependency's
manifest even when it is `optional`, so a feature gate does NOT satisfy this
(measured: `failed to load manifest for dependency low-core`).

`workers/Cargo.toml` is a second, virtual workspace with its own
`workers/Cargo.lock`: `crates/overlay-cloudflare`, `crates/low-app-layer`
and `crates/low-proof-replay` (each names it with `package.workspace`).
These link LOW's private `low-core` / `low-wire` by PATH from a `bsv-low`
checkout that must sit beside this repository. `low-proof-replay` is the
`LOW/proof/v1` replay (it was `overlay_discovery::proof::replay`);
`ProofLookupService` takes it as a hook (`with_prover`, a
`proof::BundleProver`), and with no prover it records `bundleValid = NULL`.
Both workers pass `low_proof_replay::prove_bundle`.

Cargo commands for a worker need `--manifest-path workers/Cargo.toml` (or
run inside the crate directory). `make ci` runs both workspaces.
`make ci-deploy` runs `scripts/check-workspaces.sh` first: it refuses any
`path` in a root-workspace manifest that resolves outside the repository, and
any entry of `[workspace.package]` / `[workspace.dependencies]` that differs
between `Cargo.toml` and its hand-kept mirror in `workers/Cargo.toml`.

## Dependencies

- `bsv-rs` — BSV SDK for Rust (crates.io, `overlay` feature)
- `bsv-middleware-cloudflare` — BRC-103/104 auth middleware for CF Workers (crates.io), pinned `0.3` — the same lineage the low-watchtower and low-app-layer pin
- `worker` — Cloudflare Workers Rust SDK, pinned `0.8`

**THE WORKSPACE MAY HOLD EXACTLY ONE `worker` VERSION** (bsv-low #348). `worker-build`, which runs only at DEPLOY time, resolves `worker` from the *workspace* `Cargo.lock` (the workers' one, `workers/Cargo.lock`; the root lock holds no `worker`) and takes the LOWEST version it finds there, for every crate, regardless of which crate directory it was invoked from; its per-crate disambiguation is dead code (off-by-one in `Lockfile::get_package_version`, verified in worker-build 0.7.5 / 0.8.4 / 0.8.5). Plain `cargo build` is perfectly happy with two majors, so a split is invisible to every native gate: `low-app-layer` sat undeployable for a month with `make ci` green throughout. If a crate ever needs a different `worker`, it must leave the workspace *and* stop depending on anything in it: a path dev-dep drags the other version straight back into the lock. `make ci-deploy` (part of `make ci`) is what enforces this: a lock/pin preflight plus a real `wrangler deploy --dry-run` of all three deployable configs.

## HTTP route set

27 routes total, matching `@bsv/overlay-express@2.2.0` exactly:

```
GET  /, /health, /health/live, /health/ready,
     /listTopicManagers, /listLookupServiceProviders,
     /getDocumentationForTopicManager,
     /getDocumentationForLookupServiceProvider
POST /submit, /lookup, /arc-ingest (gated on TAAL_API_KEY),
     /requestSyncResponse, /requestForeignGASPNode
GET  /admin/config (unauth)
GET  /admin/stats, /admin/ship-records, /admin/slap-records,
     /admin/bans
POST /admin/health-check, /admin/ban, /admin/unban,
     /admin/remove-token, /admin/syncAdvertisements,
     /admin/startGASPSync, /admin/evictOutpoint, /admin/janitor
```

Admin routes except `/admin/config` require `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>`.

## Submit verification (reference parity)

`Engine::submit` verifies the subject transaction the way the reference does
(`overlay-express` `Engine.submit`: `await tx.verify(this.chainTracker)`,
ts-sdk `Transaction.verify`) in every mode except `historical-tx-no-spv`
(that mode exists for GASP `finalizeGraph`, whose graphs `validateGraphAnchor`
already verified). Since 2026-09-08 the walk is
`bsv_rs::transaction::Transaction::verify` (`engine.rs`
`verify_spv_like_the_reference`): a transaction WITH a merkle path has its
root checked against the engine's `ChainTracker` and is then trusted; one
WITHOUT has EVERY input's unlocking script EXECUTED against its source output
(`bsv_rs::script::Spend`, OP_PUSH_TX-aware, ts-sdk `Spend` flags) and its
sources walked in turn. With NO chain tracker the walk is the reference's
`tx.verify('scripts only')`: roots are accepted unchecked, scripts still run.
The engine adds the one rule of the reference's walk that bsv-rs omits: an
unproven transaction may not create satoshis (`outputTotal > inputTotal`).

Before 2026-09-08 this was a divergence: a tracker-less engine checked
nothing, a tracker-ful one checked BEEF structure plus roots only
(`Beef::verify_valid`), and no script was ever executed, so an invalid spend
that no broadcaster had yet refused (or one arriving as `historical-tx`)
was admitted on structure alone.

Failures are classified so an operator can tell a bad SPEND from a bad PROOF:
`EngineError::ScriptVerificationFailed { subject_txid, input_index, reason }`
(the interpreter refused that input; `reason` is its own message) versus
`EngineError::SpvError` (bad or unverifiable proof, missing source, chain
tracker fault, the value rule). Both answer 400 on `/submit`.

**Switch:** `EngineBuilder::with_script_verification(bool)` /
`Engine::set_script_verification(bool)`, DEFAULT ON. `false` is an ESCAPE
HATCH, not a mode: it restores the pre-2026-09-08 structural check (for an
operator who must admit a body the interpreter wrongly refuses while the
defect is fixed). Executable proof, incl. two REAL mainnet OP_PUSH_TX
covenant legs and a deliberately expensive spend whose verification time is
printed: `cargo test -p bsv-overlay-engine --features memory-storage --test
script_verification -- --nocapture`. Measured natively, release profile
(2026-09-08): the real 3150-byte Poc5 covenant settle is ~1 ms end to end; a
~7 KB lock / ~20 KB unlock / ~7000-opcode spend that hashes 46 MB is 137 ms
in `Transaction::verify` (2.1 s in a debug build). Workers wasm is slower
than native; budget CPU accordingly for big covenant legs.

## GASP anchor check (bsv-low #551)

The `historical-tx-no-spv` skip above rests on
`OverlayGASPStorage::validate_graph_anchor` (`gasp_overlay.rs`), the
reference's `validateGraphAnchor`. Before a peer's graph is finalized: (1) the
ROOT node's BEEF goes through the same `verify_spv_like_the_reference` as a
submit, with the engine's chain tracker and script switch (no tracker is
`'scripts only'`); (2) the ordered BEEFs are replayed through the topic manager
over a set of coins (`historical-tx`, the coins as `previous_coins`), and the
graph is discarded WHOLE unless its root is a coin at the end. A refused graph
is counted (`TopicSyncResult::discarded_graphs`), is not an error, and the
cursor advances past it, as in the reference.

Additions to the reference, each stated in the doc comment of
`validate_graph_anchor`: a coin the storage already holds counts as a previous
coin (the walk strips held inputs, so the next head of a head chain arrives
alone); a held source is merged into the checked BEEF of an unproven node;
every node must be an input of its parent; a conflicting spend inside a graph
refuses it; and a chain tracker or storage FAULT is
`GASPError::AnchorUnavailable`, which fails the UTXO so the cursor gap guard
asks again instead of losing it. A topic manager `Err` in the replay is
`AnchorUnavailable` too (the lens fold of 2026-10-06): the manager's contract
there is one sentence, `Ok` with nothing admitted is a FINAL refusal and the
cursor moves (parity: the reference moves it past a refused and a failed graph
alike), `Err` is "not now" and the cursor waits. Its cost: a manager that
errors forever on one UTXO holds that peer's cursor below it, and what lies
above and is not yet held is walked again every tick. A manager whose rule
depends on previous coins must apply it under `historical-tx` too: that is the
mode of the replay.

The finalize submits stop at the first transaction that does not LAND
(`submit_finalized_graphs`: read from the durability report, since `submit`
answers `Ok` on a storage fault and on a manager failure): nothing behind it
in that graph is submitted, and the cursor does not pass that graph (under a
budget its UTXO fails; with none the peer's whole cursor stays for the tick).
Pins: `cargo test -p bsv-overlay-engine --features memory-storage --test
gasp_topic_manager i551` (and `fold_medium`).

## The dry-run option (bsv-low #530 E1, zanaadu-v2 #314)

`TopicManager::identify_admissible_outputs` takes the reference's fifth
argument under the reference's own name, `context: &TopicAdmittanceContext`
(`types.rs`; the reference's `context?: TopicAdmittanceContext`, `dryRun`).
The two GASP calls pass `TopicAdmittanceContext::DRY_RUN`: the needed-input
walk over every proven node of a peer (`find_needed_inputs`) and the anchor
replay of #551
(`validate_graph_anchor`). `Engine::submit` passes `dry_run: false` (the queue
replay, `/submit`, `/arc-ingest`, the peer crawler and the GASP finalize all go
through it), and `Engine::submit_validate_only`, the only other caller, passes
`true`: a validate-only call admits nothing. On a dry run a manager must
leave NO durable trace: no storage write, no head advance, no counter an
operator reads as an admission. `mode` is not a substitute: the queue replays
real submissions under `historical-tx`, the mode of both dry runs. The
workspace's 16 managers hold no state and ignore the flag; a manager that
writes on admission must read it. The method stays required, so a manager
cannot miss the argument on a re-pin. Pins: `cargo test -p bsv-overlay-engine
--features memory-storage --test gasp_topic_manager dryrun`.

## Progress under the per-peer sync budget (bsv-low #552)

`Engine::start_gasp_sync` races each peer's sync against
`set_peer_sync_budget` and drops the future at the deadline. With a budget
set, every graph is submitted AS IT FINALIZES, inside the raced future
(`gasp::FinalizedGraphHook`, the engine's `SubmitAsFinalized`; the reference
submits inside `finalizeGraph` too), after lane 551's anchor check of that
graph, so the deadline cannot take back what was finalized before it. The
deadline is COOPERATIVE around a write (the lens fold of 2026-10-06,
`gasp::SubmitGate`, `race_or_deadline_guarded`): `Engine::submit` is several
storage writes, each an await on D1, and a submit dropped between the delete
of the old head and the insert of the new one loses a head chain for good. So
each transaction's finalize submit is one write section; a deadline that falls
due inside it waits for that transaction and the sync is dropped at the
boundary, leaving an ancestors-first prefix of WHOLE transactions with the
cursor below that graph's UTXO. A request to the peer, the walk and the anchor
check are still dropped at once. The worker's outer 240 s race of
`start_gasp_sync` uses the same guarded race over
`Engine::finalize_submit_gate()`; any other caller that races
`start_gasp_sync` must too. At the
deadline the cursor is persisted at `GASPSync::completed_cursor`: strictly
below the lowest score of any UTXO not yet completed (the one in flight
included), the gap guard's rule. The graph in flight is lost WHOLE (its nodes
die with the storage adapter, nothing of it is admitted) and the next tick
walks it again, down to what the storage now holds (`find_known_utxos` skips
admitted roots, the known-input strip stops the walk at the admitted
frontier): the re-fetch cost is the nodes of that one graph fetched before
the deadline. A dropped tick that finalized a graph or moved the cursor is a
SUCCESSFUL attempt for the quarantine count. With NO budget nothing can drop
the sync and the graphs are submitted after it, as before.

The budget bounds a TICK. Nothing bounds a GRAPH (parity: the reference has
no node cap). So a chain reaches a node over several ticks only as far as the
peer lists it as several UTXOs (a record or a second output along the way,
several shards); ONE graph whose own walk outlasts the budget (a head chain
whose tip is its only UTXO) is still dropped whole on every tick, never
admitted, each tick a failed attempt toward quarantine. Resuming a walk needs
its fetched nodes persisted across ticks, which the `Storage` trait does not
offer.

`TopicSyncResult` reports `finalized_graphs`, `deadline_dropped_graphs` (at
most one per peer per sync; the same count tick after tick with no
`finalized_graphs` and no `cursor_moves` is the case above) and
`cursor_moves` (peer, from, to); the worker's `Scheduled: GASP sync` line
carries the totals and the per-topic line the cursors (`discarded_graphs` is
on the first totals line). Pins: `cargo test -p bsv-overlay-engine --features
memory-storage --test gasp_topic_manager i552` (and `fold_high1`).

## Testing

```bash
# Fast unit + integration (no network): the engine crates, then the workers
cargo test --workspace --features bsv-overlay-engine/memory-storage
cargo test --manifest-path workers/Cargo.toml --workspace

# Property tests (proptest, 256 cases each)
cargo test --workspace --features bsv-overlay-engine/memory-storage --test property_tests

# Live tests — hit a deployed overlay. Require OVERLAY_URL env var.
OVERLAY_URL=https://<your-overlay>.workers.dev \
    cargo test --workspace --features bsv-overlay-engine/memory-storage -- --ignored
```

## Parity harness

```bash
# Two shells, long-running:
make reference-up      # mainline @bsv/overlay-express@2.2.0 in docker on :8090
make wrangler-dev      # our Rust worker on :8787

# Then diff:
make harness           # writes PARITY_REPORT.md
make parity-clean      # wipe state + restart for a deterministic run
```

## End-to-end

`tools/e2e_bsv_storage.sh` (`make e2e-bsv-storage`) — round-trip smoke
against a deployed overlay + sibling UHRP storage worker. Defaults to
your prod URLs; override with `OVERLAY_URL` and `STORAGE_URL` env vars.

## Deployment

```bash
# One-time setup
wrangler d1 create bsv-overlay   # paste returned database_id into wrangler.toml
wrangler secret put ADMIN_TOKEN
wrangler secret put SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY
wrangler secret put TAAL_API_KEY   # optional — enables /arc-ingest

# Deploy
cd crates/overlay-cloudflare
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="<token>" CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="<id>" wrangler deploy
```

**Three deployable configs**, all built from the one workers' lock (`workers/Cargo.lock`): `crates/overlay-cloudflare/wrangler.toml` (`bsv-overlay-cloudflare`), `crates/overlay-cloudflare/wrangler.low.toml` (`low-overlay`, LIVE: `wrangler deploy --config wrangler.low.toml`), and `crates/low-app-layer/wrangler.toml` (`low-app-layer`). Their `[build]` worker-build pins must all match each other and the lock's `worker`; `make ci-deploy` builds all three and refuses on drift. **A green `make ci` without `ci-deploy` is not evidence a worker can be deployed**: that gap is exactly bsv-low #348.

- **Admin auth**: Bearer token on all `/admin/*` routes except `/admin/config`.
- **Cron**: `*/15 * * * *` for ad sync + GASP peer sync.
- **Extensions**: set `ENABLE_EXTENSIONS=true` to register UHRP / Agent /
  DmDelegation topic managers + lookup services beyond the mainline
  SHIP/SLAP baseline.
